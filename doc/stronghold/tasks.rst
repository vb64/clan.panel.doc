How the ally cover task list is formed for a clan
=================================================

The system analyzes the list of all clans in a coordination, ated. The following is filtered out from this list:

* Clans with a frozen SH (damaged command center or its level is lowered to 4) and clans that suspended their membership in the coordination
* Clans with the same defense hour as the ones covering them
* Clans that the covering clan plans to attack in the future
* Clans that were attacked by the covering clan less than 7 days ago

Then, for resulting clan set,  creates the list of opened defenses. The following is filtered out from this list:

* Defenses, that planned for neutrality perioad
* Defenses to begin in less than 24 hours
* Defenses for days on which the covering clan has the maximum number of battles (equal to the number of SH directions)
* If covering clan has a planned attack at this time on this day.

Tasks for different clans may differ. As more information about scheduled attacks appears on the Wargaming website and read by the clan panel, 
the completed task disappears from other clans' task lists.

.. attention::
   With free plan, task list contains inaccuracies.
   List of clans that were attacked by the covering clan less than 7 days ago, are creates when data are updating.
   To use the SH union in clan-panel is recommended to go to the 'Base' plan. With 'Base' plan, data are updating automatically every day.

   You can see saved list of recent attacks by selecting link 'Recent attacks' at tasks page.
